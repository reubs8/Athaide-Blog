I have had a great summer, working for the city.
It has been most enjoyable driving around in an electric car and dressed as a highlighter lol whilst hugging trees!
I can't wait for the next semester to start so that I can sleep in some days.
Looking forward to my Dad's visit so we can do some cool stuff together.
